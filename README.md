### Control your tokens borders. 
Player side configuration of the tokens borders, color and scale. Target HUD color and size can be altered, target HUD can also be rendered inside the token border.

Can prevent borders from showing on player clients for non-owned tokens; no longer hide your mimics behind tiles! 

Increased accessability for those with visibility impairments

External border offset changeable. 

Color gradient reads actor HP and returns a color between the two provided colors. (Currently dnd5e only)

This also fixes the current disposition bug: https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/4352

A border may be toggled off by using the Token HUD element here
